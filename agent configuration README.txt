HOW TO USE AGENT CONFIGURATION TXT FILE
=======================================

Included in this repo is "agent configuration.txt" file. This file can be used to set up a GPT agent in assistant professor role, helping students as they progress through the syllabus. 

The agent can be set up in two ways:
1. (recommended) Within a new Project: the syllabus should be uploaded in Project files and the prompt in Project configuration
2. As a new simple conversation with a GPT model: don't forget to upload the file with the initial prompt, and adjust the prompt to reference the file within the prompt upload, instead of within project files.
